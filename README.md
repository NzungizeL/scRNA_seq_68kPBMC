# scRNA_seq_68kPBMC
Single-cell-gene-expression (scRNA-seq) of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell

Main： visualization possibilities such as Scatter plots （UMAP and t-SNE)，using known marker genes to identify clusters and differentially expressed genes.

scRNA-seq technology have resulted in a wealth of studies aiming to identify transcriptomic cell types in various biological systems.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study heterogeneity and dynamic changes in cell populations
